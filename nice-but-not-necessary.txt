This is what I am not planing to implement:

* A GUI, since you had to add 95 % interface effort to 5 % core functionality
* A Windows version - Perl an Gnuplot may run there anyway, so good luck if it works
* highly configurable command line options
What might we configure?
NMEA is standard (so I hope)
If you don't need all output, delete it. Disk space is not that expensive any more.

If you want to change gnuplot options, you always can call it from the command line and load the data in interactive operation. I will add a seperate log file with all gnuplot commands, so you have an accessible ressource of cut&paste.

Therefore, I also do not plan:

* postcript / eps / svg output or whatever you might need to produce high quality publishable plots
* x11 output, even if it might add insight, if you can interactively rotate 3D-plots

And I do not want to reinvent the wheel called "anttool" from Tomoji Takasu.
So I have no plans (yet) to postprocess rtklib solution data or to analyse dual-reciver setups such as zero-baseline or short-baseline tests.

But maybe I'll try to get anttool runnning on octave & linux instead of matlab & WIN
However, this is another site of construction.

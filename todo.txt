OK	plot CNR over elev for each of satellites
OK 	plot CNR over elev for all satellites together
...     plot CNR (color coded) over elev x Azimuth for all satellites together
	aka "skyplot"
	.. needs refinement ???
...	plot CNR, elevation, azimuth over time
	.. come back after smoothing angles
*	repeat Josef Gerstenberg's variance plot
*	refine variance plot by comparing within satellite / all satellites 
*	try to compute precise confidence figures using ANOVA analysis
* 	compare against local moving average (binomial convolution filter), if possible,  including ANOVA
OK 	refine (integer valued) elev/ azimuth by time based interpolation
* 	try to perform spectral analysis to isolate interference based "Noise" from "real Noise"
*	try to explore with multidimensional data visualisation tools like 
	VTK, KitWare or ParaView
* 	try to define a small number of key figures indicating antenna performance
*	allow Glonass Format ($GL instead of $GP?)
*	try to compare different setups pair-by-pair on base of these key figures (but non the correlation of raw data, as rtklib does!)
*	switch to streaming processing to reduce huge mem requirement

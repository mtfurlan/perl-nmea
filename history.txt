add elevation over time
add skyplot (well, rough start...)
add interpolation of azimuth and eleveation between integer jumps

2013-02-22 Wolfgang Rosner
create data and chart file for each SV
create combined data and chart file for all SV
create animated gif for a sequence of each SV data
rearrange data columns to prepare for skyplot


2013-02-21 Wolfgang Rosner
create 
README.txt
to-do.txt
nice-but-not-necessary.txt
history.txt

to get documentation and planning stuff out of the code

looks like things gain vloume ... so place it on github 
URL: git@github.com:wolfgangr/perl-nmea.git

learn that gnuplot offers much more than Chart::Gnuplot provides
http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo_4.6/
and decide to switch to a native piped interface

rewrite Chart::Gnuplot based code to piped interface
provide a systematic file/folder data structure for intermediary and output files
do some first code cleanup

rearrange data for individual satellites and plot example for single SV, using Chart::Gnuplot cpan library

2013-02-18 Wolfgang Rosner
initial version with basic proof of concept:
Read and parse NMEA and extract CNR over Elevation
